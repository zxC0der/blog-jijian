# markdown-it-texmath

Add TeX math equations to your Markdown documents rendered by [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) parser. [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) is used as a fast math renderer.

## Features
Simplify the process of authoring markdown documents containing math formulas.
This extension is a comfortable tool for scientists, engineers and students with markdown as their first choice document format.

* Macro support
* Simple formula numbering
* Inline math with tables, lists and blockquote.
* User setting delimiters:
  * `'dollars'` (default)
    * inline: `$...$` or `$$...$$`
    * display: `$$...$$`
    * display + equation number: `$$...$$ (1)`
  * `'brackets'`
    * inline: `\(...\)`
    * display: `\[...\]`
    * display + equation number: `\[...\] (1)`
  * `'gitlab'`
    * inline: ``$`...`$``
    * display: `` ```math ... ``` ``
    * display + equation number: `` ```math ... ``` (1)``
  * `'julia'`
    * inline: `$...$`  or ``` ``...`` ```
    * display: `` ```math ... ``` ``
    * display + equation number: `` ```math ... ``` (1)``
  * `'kramdown'`
    * inline: ``$$...$$``
    * display: `$$...$$`
    * display + equation number: `$$...$$ (1)`

## Use with `node.js`

Install the extension. Verify having `markdown-it` and `katex` already installed .
```
npm install markdown-it-texmath
```
Use it with JavaScript.
```js
    tm = require('markdown-it-texmath'),
    md = require('markdown-it')().use(tm, { engine: require('katex'),
                                            delimiters:'dollars',
                                            katexOptions: { macros: {"\\RR": "\\mathbb{R}"} }
                                          });

md.render('Euler\'s identity \(e^{i\pi}+1=0\) is a beautiful formula in $\\RR 2$.')
```

## Dependencies

* [`markdown-it`](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it): Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [`katex`](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX): This is where credits for fast rendering TeX math in HTML go to.

## FAQ

* __Support of inline syntax of display math ?__   
  * Inline syntax of display math with `dollars` mode is supported starting from version "0.7.0". So `'This formula $$a+b=c$$ will result in display math presentation'`, i.e. gets displayed on a separate line. For *true* inline math use `$..$` mode like before.

* __Multiline diplay math in `blockquote` block possible ?__   
  * Display math inside of `blockquote` blocks is able to span multiple lines with version "0.7.3".

* __`markdown-it-texmath` with React Native does not work, why ?__
  * `markdown-it-texmath` is using regular expressions with `y` [(sticky) property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/sticky) and cannot avoid this. The use of the `y` flag in regular expressions means the plugin is not compatible with React Native (which as of now doesn't support it and throws an error `Invalid flags supplied to RegExp constructor`).

* __Why doesn't `markdown-it-texmath` work with other engines ?__
  * `markdown-it-texmath` is a personal project of mine. As it does very well with KaTeX what I want it to do, I offer it to the public as an open source plugin. I do not have time or interest to integrate other math engines.
  But if someone wants to help here out, pull requests are always welcome.


## CHANGELOG

###  [0.8.0] on July 10, 2020
* Infinite loop bug with `gitlab` mode and display math inside `blockquote` section removed.
* Fundamental redesign of display math implementation.
* Update to KaTeX version 0.12.0.

###  [0.7.2] on June 22, 2020
* Regex bug with `gitlab` mode removed.

###  [0.7.0] on June 14, 2020
* Experimental `pandoc` mode removed. Enhanced `dollars` mode now does, what `pandoc` mode was requiring.
* With `dollars` mode inline math expression `$$..$$` will result in display math presentation now. Adding equation numbers `$$..$$(1)` is not supported in inline syntax.
* Significant code redesign and regular expression optimization results in more compact code and performance gain ... not measured though.
* Bug with display math inside of `blockquote` blocks removed.

###  [0.6.9] on June 11, 2020
* Now display math inside of `blockquote` blocks can span multiple lines, provided that every line starts with a `>` character.
* Possible cause of [blockquote bug(https://github.com/goessner/mdmath/issues/50)] presumably eliminated.
* Update to `markdown-it` version 11.0.0

###  [0.6.7] on April 29, 2020
* Now supporting [katex options](https://katex.org/docs/options.html). Thanks goto [Kirill](https://github.com/xuhcc).

###  [0.6.6] on April 07, 2020
* Removed a small bug in activation method.

###  [0.6.5] on April 05, 2020
* Hand instance of `katex` over to `markdown-it-texmath` using `options.engine` object. Works with `node.js` and browsers. With `node.js` `options.engine` entry `{ engine:'katex' }` as a string also works.
* As a consequence of the topic before, the `use` method of `markdown-it-texmath` is deprecated now.
* Add beta support for [Pandoc](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/) syntax on [request](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath/issues/18). Here waiting for test results.
* Using [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/markdown-it-texmath?path=css) as cdn from now on.

###  [0.6.0] on October 04, 2019
* Add support for [Julia Markdown](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/) on [request](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath/issues/15).

###  [0.5.5] on February 07, 2019
* Remove [rendering bug with brackets delimiters](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath/issues/9).

###  [0.5.4] on January 20, 2019
* Remove pathological [bug within blockquotes](https://github.com/goessner/mdmath/issues/50).

###  [0.5.3] on November 11, 2018
* Add support for Tex macros (https://katex.org/docs/supported.html#macros) .
* Bug with [brackets delimiters](https://github.com/goessner/markdown-it-texmath/issues/9) .

###  [0.5.2] on September 07, 2018
* Add support for [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) .

###  [0.5.0] on August 15, 2018
* Fatal blockquote bug investigated. Implemented workaround to vscode bug, which has finally gone with vscode 1.26.0 .

###  [0.4.6] on January 05, 2018
* Escaped underscore bug removed.

###  [0.4.5] on November 06, 2017
* Backslash bug removed.
