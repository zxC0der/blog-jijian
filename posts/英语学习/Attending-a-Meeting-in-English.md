## 0x01 Making Accepting and Rejecting Suggestions

### Making Suggestion

When making suggestions, **modal verb** can be very useful.

Something you think is a good idea, but not an obligation:

- We **ought to** give new client a gift from the company.
- We **might** want to consider looking  for another engineer to help with this.
- I think we **should** make this a priority for this month.

Something that is an obligation:

- We **have to** imporve the way we collect and record sales data.
- We **need to** to find a cheaper solution——our budget is very tight.

Making negative suggestions:

- We **shouldn't** rush this——we need to think it through carefully.
- We **don't need to** hire new staff at the moment.

### Accepting Suggestions

- I agree with...
- That sounds good.
- Let's go with this idea.

### Rejecting Suggestions

- To be honest, I'm not sure about this idea.
- Good suggestions, but I can see a few problems...
- I see your point, however...

After a phrase like this, explain your point of view.

- I think...
- I don't think...

## 0x02 Asking Questions

You can begin with a phrase like '**sorry**', or '**excute me**' to politely bring attention to you.

### Asking questions

- I have a question. Why is...? 
- How...?
- Does this mean...?

### Asking for clarification

- I didn't understand...
- Can you elaborate on...?
- Can you clarify...?

It's important to explain exactly what you don't know or ask for clarity on something specific that they said.

## 0x03 Making Promises and Offers

### Making Offers

For something that you decide to do at that moment for the future, you can use '**will**'.

- I**'ll** call the client tomorrow.
- I**'ll** discuss this with the rest of my team and get back to you by the end of the week.

If you had a plan even before the meeting began, you can use '**going to**' or '**planning to**'.

- I'm **going to** get a team together for this project.
- I'm **planning to** do one more round of testing, and then we can go live.

If you want to make an offer, you can use '**can**', '**could**' or '**shall**'.

- I **can** contact the supplier next week if we need to.
- I **could** put together a report if you think it would help.
- **Shall** I talk to our engineering team and get a cost estimate? 

### Refusing politely

- I'm afraid I can't...
- I'm sorry, but I don't think I can...
- Unfortunately, I won't be able to...
